My first test uses a file with just “Hello World” on it in order to test if my program would
work on a small amount of text. The next three tests are boundary tests where the file either has
just one character, a repeated amount of a single character, or is empty. The compressed size of
WarAndPeace.txt is 10323 lines in comparison to the 65355 lines in the original and
decompressed file, meaning that my compression is doing a good job of actually compressing the
file.
